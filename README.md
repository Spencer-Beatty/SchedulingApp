# SchedulingApp
A Scheduling application currently in the works

The Idea for this application comes from my needs of scheduling that I face as a student. Often I am presented with a lot of deadlines with some notion of how long each might take, but most of my schedule comes from classes during the week and it can get stressful thinking about when I will do what. Often I feel that I spend too much time just thinking about when to do everything instead of just doing it.

This project is my idea to solve that by implementing an algorithm and Object Oriented programming principles to build a schedule backwards from your duedates, respecting that there are times in the day you don't want to work and fitting around events that you already have in place. My goal for this application is to be user friendly easy to use, quick, and complete such that you no longer have to worry about your deadlines, you can just get to work!

Some RoadMap Goals:

  1:  Finish Class definitions
  2:  Implement Algorithm to sort schedule requests without events.
  3:  Integrate fixed events and additional constraints into program
  4:  Create wellness and lesiure activities (out of work plans)
  5:  Finish Scheduling Algorithm
  
Phase 2 Looks
To be implemented in React
Will continue when done stage 4 or 5
